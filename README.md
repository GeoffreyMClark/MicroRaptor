# Bolt Biped

This entire library is being actively worked on and is in no way complete.

This library works toward learning a general locomotion framework for a bipedal robot. I am using the [Bolt](https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/) robot framework from the open dynamic robot initiative. Our goal is to first run simulation experiments in order to learn optimal locomotion over different terrain, after which we will do a sim-real transfer to a real-world robot.
